This blog is as of now mostly for recording my daily life in South Korea, planning to escape the frame bonding me to whatever old and outdated in my life. 

As a *full-stack software engineer* I've experienced several professional projects at companies for 3 years. I've also figured that understanding technical details must play a fundamental role for every engineer.
